== Description ==

One of the major reasons of increased churn rate i.e. a customer filling his cart with selected merchandise from your website but abandoning it before placing his order, is the long and tedious process of address filling. Pataa Navigations has the perfect solution for this problem, the Pataa Address Fill API.
Our addressing app Pataa converts a long and complex address into a unique short code like JAIN53,KUMAR100 and simplifies complex addressing systems by sharing precise geo-tagged location, user recommended routes, user recorded voice directions and more, thus making last mile navigation easy. Now instead of long address details, the customer simply enters the Pataa code (^KUMAR100) in the
address section and you can navigate straight to it without any hassle.
